# Welcome to the Make IT Wright 2025 Hackathon Repository

This year's hackathon came together because of our awesome new CS/CEG Alumni Assoctiation,

* [Their Discord](https://discord.gg/AbEeVVgeHj)
* [WSU Guardian Article about the Hackathon](https://www.wsuguardian.com/article/2025/02/wright-state-hackathon)
* [Photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/C8816oxxhzE8cKMG7)

The goals of this year's hackathon were:

* Inspire students to collaborate on new and interesting projects in the field
* Foster relationships between students and alumni (great for networking and finding out what the career is "really like")
* Challenge students to push beyond their limits to learn and make something new

Given the above I have to conclude that this year's Hackathon was a complete success.  Every team that made it across the finish line demonstrated that they have what it takes to learn, collaborate, and execute in a professional way to create a product.  I'm proud of every team that participated and can't wait to see you next year!

Thanks all!
