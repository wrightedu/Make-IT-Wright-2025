# Welcome to the Make IT Wright 2025 Hackathon Repository

This year's hackathon came together because of our awesome new CS/CEG Alumni Assoctiation,

Thanks all!

## Where we are

We had a great training and tools session last Thursday (Jan 23) and covered Git and Docker.  The details of this training can be found in this repo's `Git_and_Docker_basics` folder.

As many of you know a solid foundation in collaborative work is critical in CS and `git` has become the de-facto leader in this space.  The goals (as I understand them) of this years hackathon are as follows:

* Inspire students to collaborate on new and interesting non-academic projects in the field
* Foster relationships between students and alumni (great for networking and finding out what the career is "really like")
* Challenge students to push beyond their limits and learn or make something new

The above statement will be modified as more and more alumni see it and provide feedback but in the end the goal with any hackathon is to have fun and learn something new!  
To that end, my motto is "if its not commited it didnt happen" so I will be (with the help of others) stubbing this repository out as we go along, documenting important 
information and struggles so that (hopefully) we ALL learn something this weekend.  Anyways, if I casually say "check the repo I mean quite literally this one 
([or the corresponding wiki located here](https://github.com/wrightedu/Make-IT-Wright-2025/wiki)).

## Where we are going

Tonight @ 6:30pm in 152c Russ will be the final mingle night, where we will be presenting the Alumni Association's project ideas and talking over various student ideas.

Kickoff is tomorrow, Friday Jan. 31 @ 5pm.  Between now and then make sure you have a team, a repository, a plan, and some caffeine!  More details will follow...
