To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter of support for <full name>, a student in Wright State Universities College of Engineering and Computer Science.  They particiapted in the 2025 Make-IT-Wright Hackathon at Wright State on Jan 31 - Feb 1, 2025.  The event was co-sponsored by the new WSU CSE Alumni Association and the College of Engineering here at Wright State.  The hackathon was an immersive experience where participants interactied with alumni mentors from industry to bring their ideas to a full demonstratable product in just 24 hours.

The skills students honed at this event were multidisciplinary.  Students were required to learn and understand new technologies, deploy them via a container technology, and then build a working prototype or product with the help and guidance of our alumni association mentors.  They then created two vidoes demonstrating their product and presented their work to a panel of industry judges.

Beyond their demonstrated competency, <first name> left a mark on mentors with their open and thoughtful personality and willingness to immerse themselves in new technologies.  I would without hesitation recommend <full name> for a scholarship, internship, or professional employment.  Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information <email of Logan?>.

Sincerely,

<Signature>
